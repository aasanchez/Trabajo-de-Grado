I shared this source code of LaTeX and the PDF of my thesis that I done at
the Engineer Faculty of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM)

Every thing were done in a GNU system (Linux - Ubuntu)

The Cover was generated alone and after that it was joined with the main document by the "gs" command.
In order to save space the main temporal document PDF is not included.

People interested would see on the fact how I generated the COVER, the bibliography, the licence page, the judge page, etc.

I had erased several TEX files that do not give additional LaTeX information and I had cut some other files, this is the reason that the source code 
does not be able to be compile  without additional edition effort. There will be broken references to figures, tables, etc. However, I promise you that with this code I got the results that can be seen in the PDF. The cover and its source file (portada.tex) as well as the two figures used on that did not was changed in any way, so, it should compile at the first trial.

I include bibliography .bib files and two scripts used for compilation.

I hope the package will be useful for you and it help to save you time that can be used to research, to learn other things, to have more time with your family or what ever you want.
